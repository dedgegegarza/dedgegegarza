- 👋 Hi, I’m @dedgegegarza
- 👀 I’m interested in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology, specifically to apply principles of these fields of study to fruit breeding operations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning global prediction. And I am building tools that breeders can use to increase the efficiency of marker-assisted breeding operations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on global genomic prediction.
